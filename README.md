# MobilePhoneRecommendation
This Program suggests the user to buy the mobiles depending on the lowest price
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple java program in which we need to give the mobile name and price.
The system will recommend the top two mobiles with the lower price.
In this program we used File handling I/O, Collections, Lamda Functions,  Exception Handling and java interfaces for Upperconcat.
